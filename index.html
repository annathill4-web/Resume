        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>After working as a teacher for 8 years, both in Texas and abroad in Colombia, I took a step back from teaching in order to pursue other interests. I love learning new skills, and despite the fact that AI is now in the picture and learning web development from scratch is practically obsolete, I marched ahead. Even if AI can do it for me in a second, I like to know the "how" of things. I hope this can turn into a career for me, but even if it doesn't, I am having fun learning all about it!</p>
